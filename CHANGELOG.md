# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-27

### Changed
- **Breaking:** the generated schemas are built on zod 4 (`zod` ^4.6.7, was ^3.24.1).
  Every exported schema is now a zod 4 type, so code that composes them with its
  own zod 3 schemas has to move to zod 4 as well. The generated code uses only
  APIs that are unchanged in zod 4 (two-argument `z.record`, `z.string().pipe(z.coerce.date())`).
